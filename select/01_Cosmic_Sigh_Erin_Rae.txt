A cosmic sigh
She breathes
Something shifts beneath her wings
The winds of change are blowing

And heard on high
What sings?
I cannot believe my ears
A sudden hope is growing

But just before the old ways die
They lure they lie
They lure they lie

But on the way
The sun
Day is dawning in the soul
And warms the melancholy
And come what may
She's won
There's no need to be afraid
With her illusions falling

But just before the old ways die
They lure they lie
They lure they lie
But not before she's changed inside
And she can see
Through
The lie
